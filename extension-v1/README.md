# Web Indexer Extension

## Overview
The Web Indexer Extension is a browser extension designed to collect and index content from websites as users navigate the web. It creates an inverted index of the collected data and tracks the user's journey through a tree structure, allowing for easy retrieval and exploration of previously visited content.

## Features
- **Inverted Indexing**: Automatically indexes the content of web pages visited by the user.
- **Journey Tracking**: Records the user's navigation path, enabling a visual representation of their browsing history.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes the browser's storage API to save indexed data and user journeys for later access.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` for Chrome).
3. Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top right corner).
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `web-indexer-extension` directory.
5. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

## Usage
- Once installed, the extension will automatically start indexing content as you browse.
- You can access the indexed data and your browsing journey through the extension's popup interface.
- The popup provides options to view the indexed content and navigate through your journey.
